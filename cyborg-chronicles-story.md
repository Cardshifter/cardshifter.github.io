###Cyborg Chronicles story ideas

Cyborg Chronicles will be the first, and likely primary mod for Cardshifter. The purpose of this file is to consolidate some of the story ideas that have been proposed by game designers. 

####Early cyberpunk ideas

_Here is my suggestion for a cyberpunk / futuristic / partially post-apocalyptic theme for the "vanilla" mod of Cardshifter that we have been discussing in chat.  We tossed around the idea of cyborgs/aliens/robots as characters in that theme, and here is an elaboration on a potential story for such a world._

In the not-so-distant future, the world gets tremendously overpopulated, so much so that in many places people cannot go out onto the street without being surrounded by a crowd of people.  Pollution is everywhere, and clean water is increasingly unavailable.  They invent goggles that, when worn, completely immerse the person in a virtual world along with all the other people wearing the goggles. After a few years, conditions get so bad that most people live in small closets and spend all of their time in the virtual world.  All over the world people do this, except for a small minority of people who do not want to adopt the new technology.  They formulate a plan to migrate to Australia and form a collective. They live the old savage life without computers and virtual reality, and segregate themselves from the rest of the world.

A few years later, aliens crash land on the earth.  They are stranded in this part of space, completely out of resources, fuel and food.  They scan the Earth and realize that most of the people here are almost completely lifeless, living in small rooms, except for in Australia where they see a lot of movement and activity.  So they target Europe, crash land and start terrorizing the place, killing people and stealing whatever resources they find.

The government sends their current army of robots against them to try to stop them, but it doesn’t work.  Most of the war robots have been switched off for years because they were no longer needed to control the populace.  They try to get the people to fight against the aliens, but they are too immersed in the virtual world to want to ever fight to defend themselves.  Or maybe, by this time their consciousness stays in the virtual world if they die, so they don’t even care.

The aliens destroy lots of the cities on Earth and cause terrible devastation.  The government retreats to secret bunkers and starts inventing new robotic armies and drones to fight them. The savage outcasts of Australia defend themselves and keep  trying to preserve the old ways.  The rest of the survivors are caught in the middle, just trying to live in the virtual world still as the world collapses around them.

This is where the game begins. The outcasts are under increasingly violent attacks from both the governement and the aliens, so they have to augment their bodies with cybernetics to fight them. The government invents new and more destructive robot armies, trying to protect the remaining undestroyed cities.  And the aliens continue to attack and expand, using our technology against us to defeat us.

####Factions

Proposed by @Jay1148 [in chat](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/17281046#17281046) on 2014-08-22, in regards to possible groups/factions:

######The Celescion:
An ancient alien race that came to earth to save it. After the wars were over, the Celescion took over a good portion of the planet, inhabiting it and building cities on top of the rubble to allow the human race and any other forms of life that came to the planet an escape from the aftermath of the bioweapons that engulfed much of the world.

######Tyrakk:
Alien race that has come to seek sanctuary on earth due to a virus that broke out on their planet. They are mostly scavengers, and although not very violent, they can be very vicious if they feel threatened.

######Planet Corp.:
A military-like institution that still governs part of the world. Mainly made up what is left from the various governments and their respective military forces. They are involved in a peace treaty with the Celescion, but still believe that Earth should be left up to what is left of the human race to govern. They feel that we could have saved ourselves and did not need the help of the Celescion. 

######M.B.W.P. (Machines Built With Purpose):
A company within Planet Corp. that produces robots and machines with the duty of keeping the planet alive and running. There is quite a variety of products that come from this company, with a variety of responsibilities. 

######Go Home:
A resistance group full of activists and extremists that have waged war against all extra-terrestrial life. They are not in any way affiliated with Planet Corp.

######BioGhosts:
These are spiritual entities that were a result from the bioweapons brought by the Celescion. Once humans, these beings roam the outer lands and cause havoc with machines and robots.

####More ideas for factions

I was thinking, what if the Celescion were a group of intelligent robots built by an advanced alien race that almost completely died out long ago. They are programmed to protect life in all forms. They crash land on earth, out of resources and fuel, and find a devastated wasteland. So they set about rebuilding where they can and making a safe haven for anyone who wants to live there. 

The only catch is, you aren't allowed to kill anything, not even insects, or they kick you out. Bacteria are except from this, but only for practical reasons, otherwise they wouldn't let you kill those either. 

And I was thinking the overall story would be that the first, more vicious aliens land on earth and start destroying things, and the governments of the world fight them as hard as they can with their tanks and armies of robots, but in the end both sides are mostly destroyed. So those government leaders abandon everyone else and hide in bunkers and highly advanced arcologies with the other rich elites who were able to survive.

What we still need to answer in a way is, who is the player in all of this? what does the player represent? vogel made that point a while ago and I think it is a good one. In MTG you are a planes walker moving between crazy dimensions, and in Hearthstone you are a world of warcraft hero. Not sure what you are in YGO. so we need to have something like that too i think, or at least it would be nice.
