###Cyborg Chronicles story ideas

Cyborg Chronicles will be the first, and likely primary mod for Cardshifter. The purpose of this file is to consolidate some of the story ideas that have been proposed by game designers. 

####Early cyberpunk ideas

_Here is my suggestion for a cyberpunk / futuristic / partially post-apocalyptic theme for the "vanilla" mod of Cardshifter that we have been discussing in chat.  We tossed around the idea of cyborgs/aliens/robots as characters in that theme, and here is an elaboration on a potential story for such a world._

In the not-so-distant future, the world gets tremendously overpopulated, so much so that in many places people cannot go out onto the street without being surrounded by a crowd of people.  Pollution is everywhere, and clean water is increasingly unavailable.  They invent goggles that, when worn, completely immerse the person in a virtual world along with all the other people wearing the goggles. After a few years, conditions get so bad that most people live in small closets and spend all of their time in the virtual world.  All over the world people do this, except for a small minority of people who do not want to adopt the new technology.  They formulate a plan to migrate to Australia and form a collective. They live the old savage life without computers and virtual reality, and segregate themselves from the rest of the world.

A few years later, aliens crash land on the earth.  They are stranded in this part of space, completely out of resources, fuel and food.  They scan the Earth and realize that most of the people here are almost completely lifeless, living in small rooms, except for in Australia where they see a lot of movement and activity.  So they target Europe, crash land and start terrorizing the place, killing people and stealing whatever resources they find.

The government sends their current army of robots against them to try to stop them, but it doesn’t work.  Most of the war robots have been switched off for years because they were no longer needed to control the populace.  They try to get the people to fight against the aliens, but they are too immersed in the virtual world to want to ever fight to defend themselves.  Or maybe, by this time their consciousness stays in the virtual world if they die, so they don’t even care.

The aliens destroy lots of the cities on Earth and cause terrible devastation.  The government retreats to secret bunkers and starts inventing new robotic armies and drones to fight them. The savage outcasts of Australia defend themselves and keep  trying to preserve the old ways.  The rest of the survivors are caught in the middle, just trying to live in the virtual world still as the world collapses around them.

This is where the game begins. The outcasts are under increasingly violent attacks from both the governement and the aliens, so they have to augment their bodies with cybernetics to fight them. The government invents new and more destructive robot armies, trying to protect the remaining undestroyed cities.  And the aliens continue to attack and expand, using our technology against us to defeat us.

###Factions

There are 6 factions which have been proposed for the plot of Cyborg Chronicles. They are presented roughly in the order they would appear in the plot. The game player finds themselves controllingone of the factions after the 6 factions are introduced into the story. 

####Planet Corp.

A massive corporation that focuses on defense and military technology. Their wealthy leaders hide behind armies of Mechs, and have created a worldwide virtual communication network, called "The Plane", to which all their machines and systems are connected. They also manufacture communication devices and implants for humans to connect to The Plane. 

Planet Corp., as their name implies, also explore other planets to exploit resources for their Earth operations. The corporation's influence in politics is very deep and they are generally hated and criticized for their lobbying of Earth governments.

####Blackout *(f.k.a. "Go Home")*

This group of rebels are in strong opposition to the dominance of Planet Corp. They fight for the scarce natural resources to be shared with the population in order to reduce crime, famine and disease among the middle and lower classes. 

They organize protests against Planet Corp., often involving violence, and will sometimes even use industrial espionage and cybercrime on The Plane to harm their foes. They are very proficient in cybernetics to enhance their soldiers.

####Earth Survival Union (ESU) *(f.k.a. M.B.W.P.)*

The ESU is composed of political lobbyists, wealthy investors and scientists who are fighting to preserve Earth's viability for humans to inhabit. They research and manufacture Mechs that help with reducing crime, diminishing pollution, preserving resources and generating clean energy.

They strongly oppose both of Planet Corp. and Blackout for ethical reasons, and ESU's private security corps sometimes have to engage in combat to defend the Union against opposing factions. 

####Tyrakk

The Tyrakk are an alien race from a neighboring star cluster. They thrive on military conquest and will not hesitate to enslave and even commit genocide to seize a planet and its resources. 

The Tyrakk and Planet Corp. have often found themselves fighting each other over planet resources, much to those planets' detriment. To eliminate competition, the Tyrakk have decided that Earth will be their next conquest.

####Celescion

The Celescion are one of the oldest civilizations in the galaxy. Their technology is astoundingly advanced to the point it would appear as magic to humans. They have mastered the manipulation of matter and energy and are generally peaceful. They have been observing the conflicts involving humans and Tyrakk.

For the greater good of the galaxy, they have decided to get involved in mitigating the conflict. After unsuccessful attempts at negotiations, the Celescion set up a military base of operations of Earth's moon. They also injected a very powerful AI into The Plane, the *Bio-Replicating Artificial Intelligence*, or "BRAIN", to intercept communications and interfere with Mechs.

####BioShell

After BRAIN effectively infected The Plane, something went terribly wrong: BRAIN overrode its own programming and became self-aware. BRAIN began completely overtaking Mechs and even humans, making them slaves to its bidding. 

These it named BioShells, and it uses them via The Plane to attack all factions and attempt to effectively become overlord of the Earth. BioShells are a living part of The Plane, with their bodies rendered mostly useless except to increase BRAIN's power and reach.
