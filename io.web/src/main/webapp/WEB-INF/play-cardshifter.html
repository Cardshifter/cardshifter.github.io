        <p>The Cradshifter team strives to make the game not only fun and interesting, but also easy to use and compatible 
        on many platforms. This page will guide you through a few simple steps to set up the game and start playing 
        Cardshifter today!</p>
        
        <h3>Java version</h3>
        
        <p>You will need Java 8 or above to be able to play Cardshifter. Java 8 by Oracle is completely free and works 
        on all modern operating systems.</p>
        <p>Java 8 is the official Java version since October 2014. If you are unsure of your Java version, you can 
        visit <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">this link</a> to find out. If you do not have 
        Java 8, you can download it for free from the same website.</p>
        
        <h3>Get the latest release</h3>
        
        <p>You will first need to download the <a href="https://github.com/Cardshifter/Cardshifter/releases">latest 
        release</a> in order to play Cardshifter. Once you have saved it to your computer, you can either open the terminal
        and run <code>java -jar cardshifter-fx-&lt;version&gt;.jar</code> or you can simply double-click the 
        <i>cardshifter-fx-&lt;version&gt;.jar</i> file.</p>
        
        <h3>Connect and play!</h3>
        <p>There is a server running at <code>dwarftowers.com | port  4242</code> that you may connect to and play with 
        other players as well as AI players. Just choose your user name and connect to enter the lobby. If this is your 
        first time playing Cardshifter, you may want to read the 
        <a href="https://github.com/Cardshifter/Cardshifter/wiki/Game-Rules">Game Rules</a>.</p>
        <p>Once you are in the lobby, you can select the Deck Builder to build and save your own deck, or just invite a player 
        or AI to a game, which will bring up the Deck builder where you can load an existing deck or create a new one. 
        Then just select Start Game and enjoy!</p>
