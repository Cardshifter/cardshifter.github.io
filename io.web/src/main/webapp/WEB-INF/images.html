      	<h3>Deck Builder</h3>
      	<p>This screen displays all the available cards for you to choose, as well as any saved decks you have. You can choose up to 3 cards of each type per deck, for a total of 30 cards per deck. Use the Prev and Next buttons to scroll through the card library. To add a card, simply click it. To remove from deck, click the card in the Active Deck section. Once your deck is completed, give it a name and click <strong>Save Deck</strong>. You may load saved decks by selecting it on the right and clicking <strong>Load Deck</strong>.

      	<h3>Game scene</h3>
      	<p>This is where the action happens! The cards in your hand are displayed at the bottom, and your and your opponent's cards in play are displayed in the blue and red sections, respectively. The legend at the top will help you see what you can do each turn. On the right you will see your and your opponent's health and resources, and cards remaining in each deck. Once either player's health reaches 0, the game is over. The right side has server messages for developers that are not useful to the player, and will be removed in a future release. Enjoy!</p>
