      <p>From day one, the Cardshifter team has elevated moddability as one of the most important features we want to implement. If you have been into online gaming for any amount of time, you have no doubt seen modifications of a game made by players, using
        the same engine but with totally new gameplay. You, as a Cardshifter enthusiast, can enjoy the same type of flexibility, by either playing one of the mods, or even
        <a data-th-href="@{/new-mod}">create your own mod!</a></p>

      <p>Cybernetically-enhanced humans, battle Mechs, governments, corporations and aliens battle it out for the future of Earth in this dystopian, cyberpunk themed mod!</p>
