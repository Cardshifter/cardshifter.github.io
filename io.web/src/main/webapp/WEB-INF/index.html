        <p>Cardshifter is an open-source Trading Card Game <i>(TCG)</i> project which began in August 2014. It is being developed by a team of dedicated software programmers, web developers and designers. The project focuses on several overarching ideas.</p>

        <h2>Portability</h2>
        <p>The game client and server are being developed using the latest Java 8 and JavaFX and libGDX technology, which will ensure that the game will be highly portable to computers, tablets and mobile devices, all the while being lightweight enough not to be a burden on data plans. It will also employ vector graphics technology and will feature rich game statistics for players.</p>

        <h2>Moddability</h2>
        <p>The game will be highly moddable, in that it will allow you not only to play our game, but also make and play <i>your game</i> online with your friends on the Cardshifter servers. At the surface level, you will be able to create your own set of cards and your own game rules, with minimal to no programming knowledge. At the advanced level, should you want to use our platform and fork to make your own, that will also be possible.</p>

        <h2>Expandability</h2>
        <p>As the game is being developed, the team is making sure that the code is clear, modular, and most importantly, well documented. As such, a new member of the team can comfortably join in the programming work (we call it "fun") and explore the code base. Are you a programmer?</p>
