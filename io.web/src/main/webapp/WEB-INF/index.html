  <p>Cardshifter is an open-source online card game project which began in August 2014. It is being developed by a team of dedicated programmers and designers. The project focuses on several overarching ideas.</p>

  <h2>Portability</h2>
  <p>
    The game clients and servers are being developed with portability in mind. Using the latest and greatest in Java and web
    technologies, we develop with the intent that the game will be highly portable to modern web broswers, tablets and mobile devices.
    Online play is made simple for the players as well as the designers.

  <h2>Moddability</h2>
  <p>
    The game is highly moddable, in that it allows you not only to play our <a class="csh-nav-link" href="mods.html" data-th-href="@{/mods}">game mods</a>, 
    but also make and play <span style="font-style: italic;">your own card game</span> online with your friends!
  </p>
  <p>
    At the surface level, you will be able to create your own set of cards and your own game rules, with minimal to no programming knowledge. 
    Should you wish to get more involved, you can use our platform and fork to make your own independent client, 
    or work with us to add your game to be bundled with new releases.

  </div>

  <h2>Expandability</h2>
  <p>
    As the game is being developed, the team is making sure that the code is clear, modular, and most importantly, well documented. As such, a new member of the team can comfortably join in the programming work (we call it "fun") and explore the code base.
