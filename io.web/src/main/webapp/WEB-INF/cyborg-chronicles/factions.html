      <p>These are dark and divisive times. Humans and machines are engaged in continual conflict. Earth is in a state of depletion and chaos, so much so that is has drawn the attention of others in the galaxy.</p>
      <p>Earth's fate is in the balance, in the hands of six factions, each fighting for their own reasons...</p>

      <!-- Planet Corp. -->
      <h3><a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-planet-corp.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-planet-corp}">Planet Corp.</a></h3>
      <p>A massive corporation that focuses on defense and military technology. Their wealthy leaders hide behind armies of Mechs. The corporation's influence in politics is very deep and they are generally hated and criticized for their lobbying of governments.</p>

      <!-- Blackout -->
      <h3><a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-blackout.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-blackout}">Blackout</a></h3>
      <p>This group of rebels are in strong opposition to the dominance of Planet Corp. They fight for the scarce natural resources to be shared with the population in order to reduce crime, famine and disease among the middle and lower classes.</p>

      <!-- Earth Survival Union -->
      <h3><a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-esu.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-esu}">Earth Survival Union (ESU)</a></h3>
      <p>The ESU is composed of political lobbyists, wealthy investors and scientists who are fighting to preserve Earth's viability for humans to inhabit. They research and manufacture Mechs that help with reducing crime, diminishing pollution, preserving
        resources and generating clean energy.</p>

      <!-- Tyrakk -->
      <h3><a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-tyrakk.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-tyrakk}">Tyrakk</a></h3>
      <p>The Tyrakk are an alien race from a neighboring star cluster. They thrive on military conquest and will not hesitate to enslave and even commit genocide to seize a planet and its resources.
      </p>

      <!-- Celescion -->
      <h3><a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-celescion.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-celescion}">Celescion</a></h3>
      <p>The Celescion are one of the oldest civilizations in the galaxy. Their technology is astoundingly advanced to the point it would appear as magic to humans. They have mastered the manipulation of matter and energy and are generally peaceful. They
        have been observing the conflicts involving humans and Tyrakk from a distance.</p>

      <!-- BioShell -->
      <h3><a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-bioshell.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-bioshell}">BioShell</a></h3>
      <p>The BioShell were formerly human, but their mind got corrupted by a very advanced AI which has become self-aware. They perform the AI's bidding as it tries to take control of the global communication network, and their human brains are used as additional
        processing cores for the AI.</p>
