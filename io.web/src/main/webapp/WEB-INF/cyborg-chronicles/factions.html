						<p>These are dark and divisive times. Humans and machines are
							engaged in continual conflict. Earth is in a state of depletion
							and chaos, so much so that is has drawn the attention of others
							in the galaxy.</p>
						<p>Earth's fate is in the balance, in the hands of six
							factions, each fighting for their own reasons...</p>

						<!-- Planet Corp. -->
						<h3>
							<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-planet-corp.html"
								data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-planet-corp}">Planet
								Corp.</a>
						</h3>
						<p>
							A massive corporation that focuses on defense and military
							technology. Their wealthy leaders hide behind armies of Mechs,
							and have created a worldwide virtual communication network,
							called <i>"The Plane"</i>, to which all their machines and
							systems are connected. They also manufacture communication
							devices and implants for humans to connect to The Plane.
						</p>
						<p>Planet Corp., as their name implies, also explore other
							planets to exploit resources for their Earth operations. The
							corporation's influence in politics is very deep and they are
							generally hated and criticized for their lobbying of Earth
							governments.</p>

						<!-- Blackout -->
						<h3>
							<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-blackout.html"
								data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-blackout}">Blackout</a>
						</h3>
						<p>This group of rebels are in strong opposition to the
							dominance of Planet Corp. They fight for the scarce natural
							resources to be shared with the population in order to reduce
							crime, famine and disease among the middle and lower classes.</p>
						<p>They organize protests against Planet Corp., often
							involving violence, and will sometimes even use industrial
							espionage and cybercrime on The Plane to harm their foes. They
							are very proficient in cybernetics to enhance their soldiers.</p>

						<!-- Earth Survival Union -->
						<h3>
							<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-esu.html"
								data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-esu}">Earth
								Survival Union (ESU)</a>
						</h3>
						<p>The ESU is composed of political lobbyists, wealthy
							investors and scientists who are fighting to preserve Earth's
							viability for humans to inhabit. They research and manufacture
							Mechs that help with reducing crime, diminishing pollution,
							preserving resources and generating clean energy.</p>
						<p>They strongly oppose both of Planet Corp. and Blackout for
							ethical reasons, and ESU's private security corps sometimes have
							to engage in combat to defend the Union against opposing
							factions.</p>

						<!-- Tyrakk -->
						<h3>
							<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-tyrakk.html"
								data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-tyrakk}">Tyrakk</a>
						</h3>
						<p>The Tyrakk are an alien race from a neighboring star
							cluster. They thrive on military conquest and will not hesitate
							to enslave and even commit genocide to seize a planet and its
							resources.</p>
						<p>The Tyrakk and Planet Corp. have often found themselves
							fighting each other over planet resources, much to those planets'
							detriment. To eliminate competition, the Tyrakk have decided that
							Earth will be their next conquest.</p>

						<!-- Celescion -->
						<h3>
							<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-celescion.html"
								data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-celescion}">Celescion</a>
						</h3>
						<p>The Celescion are one of the oldest civilizations in the
							galaxy. Their technology is astoundingly advanced to the point it
							would appear as magic to humans. They have mastered the
							manipulation of matter and energy and are generally peaceful.
							They have been observing the conflicts involving humans and
							Tyrakk.</p>
						<p>
							For the greater good of the galaxy, they have decided to get
							involved in mitigating the conflict. After unsuccessful attempts
							at negotiations, the Celescion set up a military base of
							operations of Earth's moon. They also injected a very powerful AI
							into The Plane, the <i>Bio-Replicating Artificial
								Intelligence</i>, or
							<code>BRAIN</code>
							, to intercept communications and interfere with Mechs.
						</p>

						<!-- BioShell -->
						<h3>
							<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-bioshell.html"
								data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-bioshell}">BioShell</a>
						</h3>
						<p>
							After
							<code>BRAIN</code>
							effectively infected The Plane, something went terribly wrong:
							<code>BRAIN</code>
							overrode its own programming and became self-aware.
							<code>BRAIN</code>
							began completely overtaking Mechs and even humans, making them
							slaves to its bidding.
						</p>
						<p>
							These it named BioShells, and it uses them via The Plane to
							attack all factions and attempt to effectively become overlord of
							the Earth. BioShells are a living part of The Plane, with their
							bodies rendered mostly useless except to increase
							<code>BRAIN</code>
							's power and reach.
