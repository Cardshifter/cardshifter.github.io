	<h3>Summary</h3>
	
	<p>The Celescion are one of the oldest civilizations in the
	galaxy. Their technology is astoundingly advanced to the point it
	would appear as magic to humans. They have mastered the
	manipulation of matter and energy and are generally peaceful.
	They have been observing the conflicts involving humans and
	Tyrakk.</p>
	
	<p>For the greater good of the galaxy, they have decided to get
	involved in mitigating the conflict. After unsuccessful attempts
	at negotiations, the Celescion set up a military base of
	operations of Earth's moon. They also injected a very powerful AI
	into The Plane, the <i>Bio-Replicating Artificial Intelligence</i>, 
	or <code>BRAIN</code> , to intercept communications and interfere with Mechs.</p>
