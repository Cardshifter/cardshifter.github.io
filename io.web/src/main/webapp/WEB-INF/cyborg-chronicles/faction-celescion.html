    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>The Celescion are one of the oldest civilizations in the galaxy. Their technology is astoundingly advanced to the point it would appear as magic to humans. They have mastered the manipulation of matter and energy and are generally peaceful. They have
      been observing the conflicts involving humans and Tyrakk.
    </p>

    <p>For the greater good of the galaxy, they have decided to get involved in mitigating the conflict. After unsuccessful attempts at negotiations, the Celescion set up a military base of operations of Earth's moon. They also injected a very powerful AI
      into The Plane, the <i>Bio-Replicating Artificial Intelligence</i>, or
      <code>BRAIN</code> , to intercept communications and interfere with Mechs.</p>
