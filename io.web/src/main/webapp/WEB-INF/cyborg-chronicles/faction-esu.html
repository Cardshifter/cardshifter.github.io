	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>The Earth Survival Union (ESU) is composed of political lobbyists, wealthy
	investors and scientists who are fighting to preserve Earth's
	viability for humans to inhabit. They research and manufacture
	Mechs that help with reducing crime, diminishing pollution,
	preserving resources and generating clean energy.</p>

	<p>They strongly oppose both of Planet Corp. and Blackout for
	ethical reasons, and ESU's private security corps sometimes have
	to engage in combat to defend the Union against opposing
	factions.</p>
