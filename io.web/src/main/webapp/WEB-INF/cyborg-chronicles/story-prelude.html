        <h2>The Year is 2165.</h2>
        
        <p>For well over two centuries, scientists had been warning governments and the population about the fragility 
        of the Earth’s ecosystem. Alas, the race for industry and consumerism had come to a head in year 2130, when the 
        natural resources and economy collapsed. A state of emergency was declared world wide.</p>
        
        <p>A planetary <a href="faction-esu.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-esu}">Earth Survival Union</a> 
        was created to preserve what little viability is left of Earth. Drastic oversight and control measures were imposed 
        on industry, and on the population in general. The toxicity of the air and water has made it very difficult to 
        sustain food supplies for over-populated cities. Crime has become rampant. The streets are dangerous and even 
        basic necessities are very scarce.</p>
        
        <h3>Conflict arises.</h3>
        
        <p>At the center of the crisis is <a href="faction-planet-corp.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-planet-corp}">Planet Corporation</a>. 
        This global, paramilitary organization has run roughshod over the climate crisis and is determined to continue 
        production. They have seized mines, farms and many other resources for their own profit. Their lobbying of 
        governments has resulted in some officials turning a blind eye to their profiteering enterprises, 
        much to the disapproval of the Earth Survival Union.</p>
        
        <p>Large segments of the population have become cloistered, rarely leaving their residence for fear of outside 
        danger, instead choosing apathy. They instead live their lives connected to The Plane, a worldwide communication 
        and virtual reality network created by Planet Corporation.</p>
        
        <p>Another segment of the population have decided to take matters into their own hands, and formed a militia 
        called <a href="faction-blackout.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-blackout}">Blackout</a>. 
        They strongly oppose Planet Corporation and will often protest and use violent actions to try and reclaim seized 
        resources. The Earth Survival Union disapproves of Blackout’s methods, but at the same time cannot side with the 
        industry giant.</p>
        
        <p>These three factions are in a state of constant conflict and these are dark times for humanity…</p>
