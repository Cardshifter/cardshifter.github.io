        <h3>Further corruption</h3>

        <p>The AI that the <a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-celescion.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-celescion}">Celescion</a>
        had implanted into The Plane was discovered by
        <a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-planet-corp.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-planet-corp}">Planet Corporation</a>.
        They attempted to remove it, but working against advanced alien technology instead corrupted it. The AI seized
        control of a large portion of The Plane, and absorbed the minds of many of the population who were living
        connected to it, creating the <a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-bioshell.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-bioshell}">BioShell</a>.</p>

        <p>The BioShell have no free will and are slave to the AI, whose corrupted programming now coaxes them to cause
        harm to all parties.</p>

        <h2>Coming from all sides</h2>

        <p>The peace talks were not going well. The Tyrakk would have no part of it; they wanted conquest alone. In the
        face of conflict, the human factions still could not find grounds for unity. The Celescion, grieved by the
        impossible resolution, took arms as well. With the new BioShell threat in addition, the amount of chaos and
        conflict has escalated to unprecedented levels.</p>
