	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>After <code>BRAIN</code> effectively infected The Plane, something went terribly wrong:
	<code>BRAIN</code> overrode its own programming and became self-aware. <code>BRAIN</code>
	began completely overtaking Mechs and even humans, making them slaves to its bidding.</p>

	<p>These it named BioShells, and it uses them via The Plane to attack all factions and attempt
	to effectively become overlord of the Earth. BioShells are a living part of The Plane, with their
	bodies rendered mostly useless except to increase <code>BRAIN</code>'s power and reach.</p>
