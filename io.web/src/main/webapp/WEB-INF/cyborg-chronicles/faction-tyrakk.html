	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>The Tyrakk are an alien race from a neighboring star
	cluster. They thrive on military conquest and will not hesitate
	to enslave and even commit genocide to seize a planet and its
	resources.</p>

	<p>The Tyrakk and Planet Corp. have often found themselves
	fighting each other over planet resources, much to those planets'
	detriment. To eliminate competition, the Tyrakk have decided that
	Earth will be their next conquest.</p>
