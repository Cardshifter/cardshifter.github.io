        <p>The <a href="faction-tyrakk.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-tyrakk}">Tyrakk</a> were 
        well-armed, and the Conviction mission was not prepared for armed conflict. The mission was rapidly compromised 
        and taken over by the Tyrakk, and a distress signal was sent from the mission headquarters back to Earth just in time. 
        This turned out to be a grave mistake.</p>
        
        <p>Through the distress signal, the Tyrakk were able to find out Earthâ€™s coordinates in the neighboring star 
        system, and they embarked on a conquest mission. Tyrakk tech, being much more advanced than humans, would allow 
        the aggressors to reach Earth in a few short years.</p>
        
        <h3>Back on Earth</h3>
        
        <p>Armed conflicts became frequent between <a href="faction-planet-corp.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-planet-corp}">Planet Corporation</a> 
        and <a href="faction-blackout.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-blackout}">Blackout</a>. 
        The corporation ramped up their production of war Mechs, while Blackout became increasingly involved in cybernetics 
        and industrial espionage, as well as cyber crime. The 
        <a href="faction-esu.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-esu}">Earth Survival Union</a> had been 
        made aware of the distress signal sent from the base in Alpha Centauri, but did not alert the population, 
        to avoid further panic and escalation.</p>
        
        <h3>Spies in the Cosmos</h3>
        
        <p>Unbeknownst to both humans and Tyrakk, one of the oldest races in the galaxy were watching closely. The 
        <a href="faction-celescion.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-celescion}">Celescion</a> had 
        stealthy observation bases in multiple parts of Alpha Centauri and the Solar System, making them keenly aware 
        of the approaching war. They infiltrated The Plane communication system and implanted a spying AI program. 
        They also had spies among the Tyrakk systems. They wished to mitigate the conflict for the good of this sector 
        of the galaxy.</p>
        
        <h3>Meeting of the races</h3>
        
        <p>The day had finally come. The Tyrakk landed on Earth on what was formerly known as Australia, which had 
        become deserted by arid climates. They launched a few attacks on humans in Asia and South America, causing terror, 
        and immediately getting the attention of the world governments and Planet Corporation. Upon seeing violent 
        conflict, the Celescion also revealed themselves in Europe and contacted the Earth Survival Union to attempt 
        peace negotiations.</p>
        
        <p>The Earth will never be the same again.</p>
