	<h3>Species Description</h3>
	
	<ul>
  		<li>Homo sapiens sapiens (Hominidae family)</li>
		<li>Originated circa 250,000 years ago</li>
  		<li>Home planet: Earth</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Faction Origins</h3>
	
	<p>Blackout was founded by a former Planet Corporation researcher, Lead Engineer Richard Lark, in 2139. Lark has been
	renowned worldwide for his creation of the S.T.E.M. system, which allows for Cybernetics to be applied in the field 
	without the needs for invasive surgery. This changed the face of cybernetics, and allowed Planet Corporation to become 
	a global entity for supplying and maintaining the cybernetics currently in the field. </p>
	
	<p>Lark resigned from his position in 2130 due to grievances over Planet Corporation’s use of the S.T.E.M. for
	paramilitary purposes. Over the next decade Lark became a lobbyist and public demonstrator against the very system he
	created, and Planet Corporation itself. He amassed a large and loyal following.</p>
	
	<h3>Faction Aspirations</h3>
	
	<p>After Planet Corporation seized control over thousands of plots of land owned by citizens, Lark knew change could
	only come by his hand. He rallied his followers, and with his extensive knowledge in cybernetics, the fight began 
	against Planet Corporation by his people. In the coming months Blackout was born. Using their advanced cybernetics and
	Lark’s intimate knowledge of the S.T.E.M system, their goal was to bring down Planet Corporation by crippling the very
	system he had created.</p>
	
	<p>Their tactics vary between peaceful protest and more aggressive actions, such as industrial espionage, cybercrime
	and violent coups against Planet Corporation executives. The Earth Survival Union does not approve of Blackout’s
	militia-style tactics and often denounces them publically. </p>
