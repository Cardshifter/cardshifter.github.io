      <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rules effective for game version: 0.5 Alpha release</span>
    </p>
    <p>Updated: 2015-02-13</p>
    <h2>General rules</h2>
    <p>
      Each player has access to the same library of 25 cards. More will be added in future releases. Upon starting a game with a player or AI, the player is prompted to build a deck to play with from the library. The player may also load a deck previously saved
      from a previous game. Each deck must contain exactly 30 cards, with no more than 3 copies of any individual card per deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the game begins, each player draws a hand of 5 cards, and is given the opportunity to mulligan none, any or all of those 5 cards once for new cards. The cards chosen for mulligan are reshuffled into the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining cards are placed to the side and comprise the player's Draw deck. Once destroyed, scrapped, or used, cards are placed in a pile next to the draw deck called the Discard pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with a randomly chosen player, play alternates back and forth between the players. The player may play as many cards as they can afford to play during their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each card has a cost in either Mana or Scrap. Each turn, the players' Mana Total increases by 1, starting with 1 on the first turn. Mana is returned to the current Mana Total at the start of each turn. Unused mana is lost at the end of a turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain Scrap, a player takes a Scrap-able card that is currently in their field and places it in their discard pile. Scrap only depletes when it is used, and is only accumulated when cards are Scrapped.
    </p>

    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of the game is reduce the other players health to zero. Each player starts with 10 health. Damage is caused to the other player by attacking them directly with units or by spillover damage. Spells are not currently in the game; they will be in
      a future release.
    </p>

    <h3>Game flow</h3>
    <p>
      Each player has a Field in front of them which contains all of the units that they have played. When a unit is played, it has the Sickness on that turn and may not attack until the next turn. A player may choose to attack with any unit that does not have
      the Sickness. There is no limit to the number of units that a player may have on the Field.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a player attacks, if the opposing player has any units in their Field, the attacking player must direct their attack against one of those units. If they have no units in their Field, the opposing player may be attacked directly. If attacking a unit,
      the Strength of the attacking unit is compared against the Health of the defending unit. If the Strength is greater, the defending unit is destroyed. The Strength of the defending unit is also compared against the Health of the attacking unit, and
      if it is greater, the attacking unit is destroyed.
    </p>

    <h3>Card types</h3>
    <p>
      There are currently 3 types of cards. More will be supported in later versions.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bios:</strong> These cards have 0 or more Strength points, and 1 or more Health points. They can be Upgraded but not Scrapped. They are cast using Mana points and they are used for attacking and defending.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mechs:</strong> These cards have 0 or more Strength points, and 1 or more Health points, as well as a Scrap value. They can be scrapped, but not upgraded. They are cast using Mana points and they are used for attacking and defending.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Upgrades:</strong> These cards have 0 or more Strength points, and 0 or more Health points. They cannot be cast onto the playing field as standalone, they have to be cast upon an eligible creature card. They increase the Strength and/or Health
        of the target by their own Strength and Health values. These cards are cast with Scrap points and are discarded along with the target if it is destroyed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cards with effects</h3>
    <p>
      Certain cards have unique Effects which can give the player a tactical advantage. Some Upgrades can also grant an Effect onto a card. The effects are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rush:</strong> A card with Rush does not have the Sickness upon being cast onto the Field. Therefore, it can attack immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ranged:</strong> A card with Ranged does not take any repercussion damage when attacking. Therefore, its target's Strength does not get applied against the card's Health upon attacking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heal:</strong> A card with Heal will regenerate 1 Health per turn to the player who has that card cast in their Field. When the card is eliminated, the effect ceases.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Summon:</strong> A card with Summon will cast additional cards in the Field at no cost.
      </li>
    </ul>
