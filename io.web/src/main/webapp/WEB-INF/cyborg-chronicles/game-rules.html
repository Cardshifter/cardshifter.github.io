    </p>

    <h2>General rules</h2>
    <p>
      Each player has access to the same library of cards. Upon starting a game with a player or AI, the player is 
      prompted to build a deck to play with from the library. The player may also load a deck previously saved
      from a previous game, or load one of the decks provided with the game. Each deck must contain exactly 30 cards. 
      By default, a player can have up to 3 copies of any given cards, although some individual cards may have a
      different limit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the game begins, each player draws a hand of 5 cards, and is given the opportunity to mulligan 
      none, any or all of those 5 cards in exchange for new cards. The cards chosen for mulligan are reshuffled 
      into the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining cards are placed to the side and comprise the player's Draw deck. Once destroyed or scrapped, 
      cards are placed in the Discard pile.<br />
      <i>Note: There are no Discard pile mechanics supported at this time, but will be in a future release.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting with a randomly chosen player, play alternates back and forth between the players. 
      The player may play as many cards as they can afford to play during their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each card has a cost in either Mana or Scrap. Each turn, the players' maximum Mana increases by 1, 
      starting with 1 on the first turn and up to a maximum of 10 total. Mana is returned to the current maximum Mana 
      at the start of each turn. Unused mana is lost at the end of a turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      To gain Scrap, a player takes a Scrappable card that is currently in their field selects the Scrap option, 
      which destroys the card and adds its Scrap value to the player's Scrap resource. 
      Scrap only depletes when it is used, and is only accumulated when cards are Scrapped.
    </p>

    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>
      The goal of the game is reduce the other players health to zero. Each player starts with 30 health. 
      Damage is caused to the other player by attacking them directly with units. A player cannot be attacked directly
      if they have creatures in their Battlefield; the creatures must be destroyed first.
      Some card effects and spells can damage the player directly even if they have creatures in their Battlefield.
    </p>

    <h3>Game flow</h3>
    <p>
      Each player has a Battlefield which contains all of the units that they have played. 
      When a unit is played, it has the Sickness on that turn and may not attack until the next turn, unless the card
      has the Rush effect, which overrides the Sickness. 
      There is no limit to the number of units that a player may have on the Battlefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a player attacks, if the opposing player has any units in their Battlefield, the attacking player 
      must direct their attack against one of those units. If they have no units in their Battlefield, the opposing player 
      can be attacked directly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When a creature attacks another, they damage each other with their Attack value against their Health value.
      If a creature's Health reaches 0, it is destroyed, regardless of whether it is the attacking or defending unit.
      If a creature survives an attack, its health will be reduced according to the other creature's Attack value.
      Creatures' health is restored to their maximum health at the end of each turn. 
    </p>

    <h3>Card types</h3>
    <p>
      There are currently 4 types of cards.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Bios:</strong> These cards have 0 or more Attack points, and 1 or more Health points. 
        They can be Upgraded using Enchantments, but not Scrapped. They are cast using Mana points and they are used for 
        attacking and defending.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mechs:</strong> These cards have 0 or more Attack points, and 1 or more Health points, 
        as well as a Scrap value. They can be Scrapped, but not upgraded. They are cast using Mana points 
        and they are used for attacking and defending.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enchantments:</strong> These cards change Attack and/or Health values of a creature.
        They cannot be cast onto the playing field as standalone, they have to be cast upon an eligible Bio card. 
        These cards are cast with Scrap points and are discarded after being played on a target and its effect applied.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spells:</strong> These cards are one-time use and can cause a variety of effects, 
        which will be described on each spell card.
        These cards never enter the Battlefield. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cards with effects</h3>
    <p>
      Certain cards have unique Effects which can give the player a tactical advantage. Some Upgrades can also grant an Effect onto a card. The effects are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Rush:</strong> A card with Rush does not have the Sickness upon being cast onto the Battlefield. 
        Therefore, it can attack immediately.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ranged:</strong> A card with Ranged does not take any repercussion damage when attacking. 
        Therefore, its target's Attack does not get applied against the card's Health upon attacking.
        However, it has to take one turn to reload after attacking. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Others:</strong> There is a multitude of other types of effects which are unique to each card.
        Each of those will be described on the cards themselves. They include anything from summoning other cards,
        modifying Attack or Health values of creatures in play, damaging or healing players, etc.
      </li>
    </ul>
