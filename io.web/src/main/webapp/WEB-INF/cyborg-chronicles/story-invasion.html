        <h3>The &ldquo;Conviction&rdquo; Mission</h3>

        <p>In 2134 the <a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-esu.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-esu}">Earth Survival Union</a>,
        in cooperation with <a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-planet-corp.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-planet-corp}">Planet Corporation</a>,
        began planning are very long and treacherous mission. In years prior, an exoplanet in the relatively nearby Alpha
        Centauri star system, had been surveyed from a distance by unmanned missions. It had been found that the planet
        appears to be rich in Earth-like resources, and may in fact not be too hostile for a permanent mining operation
        to be settled there.</p>

        <p>The mission was named &ldquo;Conviction&rdquo; and research in technology began promptly and continued for over a decade.
        Conviction was launched in 2155, one large ship full or researchers and workers, and another full of industrial
        Mechs manufactured by Planet Corporation which were to be used for construction and mining. It took over 8 years
        for the mission to reach its destination safely.</p>

        <h3>Unforeseen findings</h3>

        <p>Upon arrival, Conviction began deploying a base of operations for mining, and several factories for processing
        extracted minerals and for building more machines and ships. The operation was going relatively well, with few
        major hardships besides the occasional mining or transport incident. They had gathered a massive shipment of
        minerals which they were preparing to send back to Earth. </p>

        <p>On the launch day of the shipment, a major propulsion failure caused the ship to misfire and crash a few dozen
        kilometers from its launching pad, never leaving the planet’s gravitational pull. Upon investigation, it appeared
        that the ship was sabotaged from the inside. Hope among the mission quickly gave way to suspicion and depression.</p>

	<h3>No longer alone</h3>

	<p>More exploration was conducted on the planet’s surface to find more resources to gather. Approximately 730
	kilometers from the home the explorers saw something strange in the distance: a large structure, obviously
	artificial stood over the horizon. As they approached the structure to observe it, they got spotted and captured.
	What they found out was astonishing.</p>

	<p>The explorers were able to activate their distress signals prior to being captured. Conviction sent out a
	larger party and as they neared the mysterious structure, they were attacked and had to retreat. The attackers
	followed the rescue party back, and there began the first encounter with the
	<a class="csh-bypass-link-color" href="faction-tyrakk.html" data-th-href="@{/cyborg-chronicles/faction-tyrakk}">Tyrakk</a> race. With that,
	war started in Alpha Centauri. </p>
