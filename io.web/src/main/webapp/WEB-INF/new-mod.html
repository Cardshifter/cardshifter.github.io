        <p>At Cardshifter, from Day One we have strived for "moddability", as in, 
        the possibility and relative ease for someone who is interested in the Cardshifter platform
        to create their own "mod" (or modification) of the game.</p>
        
        <p>This page, though only partial at the moment, is intended to help direct you in that endeavor.</p>
        
        <h3>Why start a new mod?</h3>
        
        <p>Great question! Here are a few scenarios that, should some apply to you, could make you a potential modder:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>You have tried Cardshifter and imagined some creative ideas for a whole new theme or game style;</li>
          <li>You have played one of the current mods, but find that you would want to make a game with new mechanics;</li>
          <li>You have always dreamed of starting your own multiplayer card strategy game but do not have a platform to build upon.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>At the current time, there is no "official" guide to starting a mod. That is a work in progress. 
        The best way to get started would be to <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/16134/tcg-creation">join us 
        in the Cradshifter chat room</a>. If you prefer you may also <a href="https://github.com/Cardshifter/Cardshifter/issues/new">create 
        a new issue on Github</a>. Finally, you can also <a href="mailto:cardshifter@psychoproductions.net?Subject=New%20mod%20ideas">
        email us</a> with your ideas. 
        Either way, you can discuss directly with our developers and designers about your modding ideas!
        </p>
        
        <h3>Happy Modding!</h3>
