##Guidelines for images

######_Last revision: 2015-30-01_

Make sure to save images in the appropriate sub-folder. Do not save any images in the main `images/` folder. 

####Logos

- Folder: `images/logos/`

- Use for logos and similar branding images. 

- These will normally be PNG files, or SVG for vectorial images in some cases.

- Use descriptive naming. For example, use `Twitter_logo_blue.png` rather than `Twitter.png`.

####Screenshots

- Folder: `images/screenshots/`

- Use for game and other screenshots of the applications. 

- These will normally be PNG files, unless they contain significant photographic (rasterized) elements, in which case you may use JPG. Do not use SVG images for screenshots.

- Use versioned naming to represent which application version they come from. Be sure to update the `images.html` file in [WEB-INF](https://github.com/Cardshifter/cardshifter.github.io/tree/web-content/io.web/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF) so that the most current version is displayed on the site.

- Example naming for release 0.4: `0.4-deck-builder.png`

####Card pictures

- Folder: `images/card-pictures/`

- Use for images that are tied to playing cards in the Cardshifter game, to be displayed in a future card gallery.

- These will normally be SVG vector images, as they will be drawn and colored by artist contributors. If an image contains mostly photographic/rasterized content, use JPG instead. 

- Simply use the card name for naming purposes, e.g.: `heavy-mech.svg`
